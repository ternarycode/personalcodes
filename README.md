# personalcodes
Welcome to my repository of personal codes where I just code whatever I want on here!
It could be anything, from something trivial to something that could break your computer once you run it.

Please, come a take a look!

## operations.py
I *could* consider this as my sort of "hello world" for Python, but not necessarily as a replacement.
Still, this is a good way to see if Python's input, operation, and output commands still work!


## ascii_code.c
Ah yes, this block of code. 
When I realized that you can increment char values in C, I just had to go crazy go stupid with it.
So I made this forever loop so that it'll print out the ASCII characters in ascending order, then overflow and start over again!
...Ok, fine, I also added one which printed out all ASCII one time so that it won't instantly brick your computer. Woop dee do.
